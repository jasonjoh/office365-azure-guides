# Office 365 APIs, Azure, and OAuth2 Guides #

This is just a quick little repo I made so I could put out guides to address common questions I see on Stack Overflow or the MSDN forums. I'll likely add more guides as they come up. If there's a topic you'd really like to see covered, send me a message on Twitter: [@JasonJohMSFT](https://twitter.com/JasonJohMSFT).

## Guide list ##
